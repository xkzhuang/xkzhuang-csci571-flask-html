Drafted Initial Prompt:

Help me initialize a python flask project with following requirements:
1) it has two services:
   - Ticketmaster service
     - needs apikey
     - base endpoint is "https://app.ticketmaster.com/discovery/v2"
     - expose a public method: get(subpath, params)
       it will make api calls along with apikey and return the response
   - Google map service
     - needs apikey
     - it takes location string and use google map api to get geohash

2) this python flask proj has following routes:
   - "/", or "/index.html" 
   - "/search/events"
   - "/search/event/<string:event_id>"
   - "/search/venues/<string:venue_id>"
3) this python flask proj has a search blueprint with following GET methods:
   - get_events for route ("/search/events")
     - input: keyword,distance,category,location
     - call Ticketmaster service get("/events", params)
     - we need to compose above input params (dict) for Ticketmaster service:
       - apikey: ticketmaster api key
       - unit: miles
       - radius: get_events "distance"
       - keyword: get_events "keyword"
       - geoPoint: Google Map service converted geohash from get_events "locaton"
     - The output of the ticketmaster service will be parsed and extracted and return to UI with following fields
       - "id": response -> id
       - "name": reponse -> name
       - "dateTime": localDate and localTime from response -> dates -> start, localTime might not exist
       - "genre": reponse -> classifications -> segment -> name 
         - if Undefined or not exist then use this fallback: "genre.name", "subgenre.name", "type.name", "subtype.name"
         - choose the one classification whose primary is true first                  
       - "venue": response -> _embedded -> venues -> name 
       - "icon": response -> images -> url (choose the one that has smallest width x height)
       
   - get_event_for_id for route ("/search/event/<string:event_id")
     - input: event_id
     - call ticketmaster service get("/events/<event_id>", params)
     - params just the apikey
     - just send the response to UI

   - get_venue_for_id for route ("/search/venues/<strng:venue_id")
     - input: veune_id
     - call ticketmaster service get("/venues/<venue_id>", params)
     - params just the apikey
     - just send the response to UI

4) This python flask proj also has "index.html" with following designs:
   - background image from "/media/background.jpg"
   - user input form with following items:
     - required input Keyword: string
     - required input Distance(miles): positive integer, default to 10
     - requried input Category: dropdown with 6 items: "Default","Music","Sports","Arts & Theatre", "Film", "Miscellaneous", default to "Default"
     - required input Location: stringo
     - input Auto-Detect Location: checkbox
     - SEARCH button and CLEAR button
   - The layout of the form should have 4 rows
     - row 1: stacked Keyword label and inputbox
     - row 2: stacked label+input for Distance align on the left
              statcked label+input for Category align on the right
     - row 3: stacked label+input for location
              checkbox+label should be next to the location label
     - row 4: SEARCH and CLEAR button
   - SEARCH button will trigger a backend call "/search/events" with keyword,distance,category,location
     - The response from backend is array of maps contains 6 keys: id,name,dateTime,genre,venue,icon
     - The response from backend will be used to populate a 6 column table: 
       - Date, Icon, Event, Genre, Venue, and a hidden column ID, where dateTIme for "Date" and name for "Event"
     - The table will be inside a new container below the form container
     - The Event cell of each row shall be clickable:
       - upon clicking, it will trigger a fetch call to backend: "/search/event/<id of the row>"
       - The response from backend will be used to populate event detail container below table container
       - browser shall auto-scroll to have event detail container in the center of the browser
       - the event detail container should be layout-ed as stacked key-value pairs using the response
   - CLEAR button should reset all the input fields from the form to empty or default values and remove the search result table as well as the event detail container

--- Entry 1 ---
Role: Assistant
Summary: Scaffolded Flask app in assignment2-flask with:
 - app.py serving '/' and '/index.html'; media route for background
 - blueprints/search.py with routes '/search/events' and '/search/event/<id>'
 - services: GoogleMapService (geocode -> geohash), TicketMasterService (get)
 - templates/index.html: form (Keyword, Distance, Category, Location, Auto-Detect), SEARCH/CLEAR, table render
 - requirements.txt, README.md, .env.example
Validation: Local smoke test for '/' passed; validation errors tested for '/search/events'.

What I created
assignment2-flask-app/app.py — Flask app, env-driven config, index routes, registers blueprint
assignment2-flask-app/blueprints/search.py — Search blueprint with the 3 GET endpoints and parsing logic
assignment2-flask-app/services/ticketmaster_service.py — Ticketmaster service with get(subpath, params)
assignment2-flask-app/services/google_map_service.py — Google Maps geocoding + local geohash encoder
assignment2-flask-app/templates/index.html — UI form, results table, event details container, Fetch logic for search and event details, clear handler, Basic layout and styling
assignment2-flask-app/requirements.txt — Flask + requests
assignment2-flask-app/README.md — How to run locally



=========================================================
Here we have issues:
=========================================================
 - After check I realize that I need to update flask route for get_event_by_id to be consistent with ticketmaster endpoint
   So, the new route should be "/search/events/<string:event_id>"
 - And after playing around, I notice that I need to also implement a new method: getGeoHashFromLatLng to deal with cases where users pass in lat/lng instead of address
 - And because I didn't specify the category to segmentId mappings, I have to fix it in this iteration:
   so I will ask AI to create a method: mapToSegmentId with mappings from the HW2 pdf


--- Entry 2 ---
Role: Assistant
Summary: Fixed small issues:
 - Corrected event-by-id endpoint to '/events/<id>' per spec
 - Exposed helper getGeoHashFromLatLng and supported 'lat,lon' input bypassing geocoder
 - Ensured 'mapToSegmentId' name exactly as requested
 - Resolved indentation and minor issues in blueprint
Validation: Lint check OK; additional smoke tests for validation responses passed.
